# Breast Cancer Wisconsin Classification
## Breast Cancer Classification Using Decision Tree Algorithm
The Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) Classification project using Decision Tree Algorithm is one of the popular applications in machine learning. This dataset comes from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and is also available in the Skicit-Learn library which is used to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant.
## Project Overview
This dataset consists of 569 samples with 30 numerical features that include characteristics of the tumor tissue mass, such as size, circumference, texture, and neatness of the tumor cell edges.
## Project Goals
The breast cancer classification project using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset has several important goals related to medical applications and machine learning. Here are some of the main goals:
1. Building a breast tumors classification model using the Decision Tree Algorithm
2. Analyze tumor characteristics with good accuracy
3. Visualize data using the Decision Tree Algorithm with the model that has been created and with good accuracy
## Conclusion
The Breast Cancer Classification project using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset shows that Machine Learning technology can make a major contribution to the medical world, especially in helping the process of diagnosing diseases quickly and accurately. By utilizing Machine Learning Algorithms such as Decision Tree, this project is able to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on the physical characteristics of the tumor, such as size, texture, and cell symmetry.
